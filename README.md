# STM32F4 Discovery MCU Projects
A testing ground for experimenting with the different capabilities of the STM32F4 Discovery board. 
Each project aims to achieve simple goals with different technologies or protocols to aid my own learning.

### 01. LED
1) Get an LED to turn on and off
2) Get a button press to turn the LED on and off using interrupts
3) Introduce a delay to debounce the button in software 

### 02. Thermo 13 Click Board
1) Use I2C to communicate with the temperature sensor -- Read a temperature
2) Investigate ways to poll the sensor reliably
